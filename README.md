## Idea for codefundoo++

- We are planning to build and API that would be focussing on predicting and managing the natural disaster **flood**.


- In our project we will predict the flood on the basis of the rainfall patterns in a particular region and distance of the nearest river. We will calculate the  water level rise in a river and decide whether or not the river will be flooded, also we will predict the time of the effect of flood to reach the places in the course of river, and will notify people about the same.We will keep a note for the approximate population density of the places which are nearby to the course of river so that people can be relocated evenly in safer areas without much clustering at one place.


- And since we have to implement it in areas with internet connectivity issues, we will use **colour codes** which will describe the danger level of the situation(i.e time left before the river starts to overflow in that area) to notify people as well as the panchayat of each village area or the municipal corporation of the town , so that they can help in proper reallocation of people within stipulated time. Colour codes will ensure that even an illiterate person can realize the possible threat. This is the basic idea for our codefundo++ project.


- We will require rainfall dataset , Dataset for the geographical location of the rivers and their water level , and population dataset.


- We will be using Data Science and API (might also require Geocoding).
